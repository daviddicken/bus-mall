This is a app loaded with images of unique products.
It will show 'x' amount of pictures to the user and ask the user to select which one they would most likely purchase. 
It will save their selection and show them the next set of pictures.
The next set of pictures is completely different from the set of pictures shown before.
This program will generate new photos until the desired amount of user selections has been reached.
At that point it will display a bar graph showing each item and how many times it was shown and how many times it was voted for.
This program saves to local memory so the amount shown and times voted for in the graph gets added to the amount from the last users to have ran the program. This will continue until local storage is cleared.

The number of images shown to the user to choose from and the number of times the program will ask the user to make a choice can both be set in the global variables.
